        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>
            Hello! I am a dedicated and enthusiastic student with a strong interest in
            technology, creativity, and hands-on learning. I enjoy exploring new concepts,
            solving problems, and continuously improving my skills.
        </p>

        <p>
            Along with academic learning, I am passionate about web development and enjoy
            creating clean and simple webpages using HTML and CSS. I believe in
            consistent learning and taking up new challenges to grow myself.
        </p>

        <p>
            This portfolio is a small representation of my skills, interests, and the
            work I look forward to doing in the field of technology.
        </p>
